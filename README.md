Software to test the functionality of whisper and gpt. In general, this program takes audio from the computer, creates chunks of local audio files and sends them to Whisper for transcription, then sends the text transcribed by Whisper to gpt for translation into the chosen language..

### GTP Api Key 
You need to use a GPT API key to interact with whisper and GPT.
### Audio chunk time
This is the audio capture interval to send to whisper, for a more "real-time", you need smaller values, but you will have more requests to whisper.
